# Lambda_Interpreter
### Lambda Interpreter

The Lambda Interpreter allows you to run programs written in a custom functional programming language. You can use the interpreter in two modes:

#### Interactive Mode
- **Purpose**: Execute commands line by line, ideal for testing and experimentation.
- **Usage**:
  1. Run the interpreter without any arguments:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
  2. Type commands at the `>>>` prompt.
  3. The interpreter will print the result of each command.
  4. Exit by typing `exit` or `quit`.

#### File Execution Mode
- **Purpose**: Execute an entire program from a file.
- **Usage**:
  1. Ensure your program is saved with a `.lambda` file extension.
  2. Run the interpreter with the file name as an argument:
     ```bash
     python main.py your_program.lambda
     ```
  3. The interpreter will execute the program and print the result.

Enjoy using the Lambda Interpreter!
